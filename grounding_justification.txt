Grounding Justification — Adaptive Learning Companion
=======================================================

Why does this agent specifically need the ingested course data
instead of relying on the LLM's pre-trained knowledge?

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. COURSE-SPECIFIC ACCURACY
   The LLM was trained on general internet data, not on the exact
   textbook, lecture notes, or lab materials used in this course.
   Explanations must match the specific notation, terminology, and
   examples the student sees in class. A student asking "explain
   Lab 2 Task 3" needs an answer grounded in *their* lab sheet —
   not a generic internet definition that uses different vocabulary
   or covers a different curriculum.

2. PREVENTING HALLUCINATION
   LLMs confidently generate plausible-sounding but incorrect
   information when asked about specific course content they were
   not trained on. Grounding the agent in the vector database means
   every explanation is traceable to a real source document and a
   real page number — the agent cannot fabricate content it did not
   retrieve.

3. PERSONALISED DIFFICULTY MATCHING
   The vector store's metadata (difficulty, content_type) allows the
   agent to retrieve beginner vs. advanced explanations of the same
   topic. The LLM's pre-trained brain has no concept of what "beginner"
   means for *this specific course* — it would default to a one-size-
   fits-all explanation that is often too abstract for struggling
   students.

4. PREREQUISITE MAPPING
   The agent must know which topics must be understood before teaching
   a new concept (e.g., "you must understand cell structure before
   photosynthesis"). This dependency graph is encoded in the ingested
   course materials. It is not something a general-purpose LLM can
   infer reliably for a custom curriculum.

5. PRACTICE PROBLEMS
   The agent generates practice questions by retrieving real exercises
   from the course material rather than inventing them. This ensures
   problems are aligned with the actual exam style, marking scheme,
   and difficulty progression — something the LLM cannot guarantee
   on its own.

6. UPDATABILITY
   Course materials change every semester. The vector database can be
   re-ingested with new PDFs without retraining the LLM. The agent
   stays current with the latest curriculum simply by running
   ingest_data.py again.

Conclusion: The agent's value comes from combining the LLM's
reasoning ability with precise, course-specific knowledge from
the vector store. Without the ingested data, the agent is just
a generic chatbot. With it, it becomes a tutor that knows exactly
what this student needs to learn and can prove every explanation
with a source.
